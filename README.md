#### Task 0

That was simple amazing!
I wish I had that kind of teaching at school or university.
First, the purpose of the VCS was described: like what is it, and why it is still alive :-)
Than learning process was orginized in step-by-step manner, with a lot "tips and tricks", and practice, holy practice.
In general - interesting, sometimes, funny and very exciting.

Thanks a lot to the Internet revolution for this posibility!
And thank you guys for what you are doing!
That encourage people like me going ahead... and doing crazy things))
